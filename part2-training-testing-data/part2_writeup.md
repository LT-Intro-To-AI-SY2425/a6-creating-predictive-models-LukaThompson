# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
There is more data wich narrows down the bfl and makes the predictions more accurate

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tells me that the model is not very accurate because it is 0.63 which means the accuracy is around 63%

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would not say the model is accurate becuase it is only 63% our of 100% accurate. The values are not very accurae as mot o them are off by around 5 wich is fairly big. Ideally, it should be closer to less than 1 because that means that the predictions are almost exact which allows other predictions to be more accurate
