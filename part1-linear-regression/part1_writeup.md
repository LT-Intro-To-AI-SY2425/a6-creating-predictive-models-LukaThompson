# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
the r squared value is 0.626. This says that the linear regression model is not bad but it is not very strong as there are less points near the line which means that the data is more varied
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
It predicts that the persons blood pressure would be 136.5
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
It was not accurate as it was off by a a difference of 12.5 which is fairly large. I would say that it is not reliable at predicting someone's blood pressure based on their age as it was wrong by a lot. The model could be improved by adding more data and taking more than one peice of data for an age so there is a better average.
