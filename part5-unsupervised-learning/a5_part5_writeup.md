# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
Overspenders are people that spend a lot but don't have enough disposable income they overspend on things they dont need and are not able to make more money cuz they spend it all. Average are people that have an average income and average spending score. Most people probably fall into this group as most people are average. Extravagent are the people who have a lot of money and spend a lot of money because they have disposable income. They are the people with big houses and lots of things they don't need but have because they can. Savers are people who have a higher income but don't like to spend a lot of money and they would rather save their money and get more over time. Minimum are the people who don't have a high income so can't buy lots of things so that they can get by. They spend money on things that are neccesary but not on things that they don't fully need.
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
I would put them in the saver category because they have enough money to get by plus some disposible income but they choose not to spend their extra money to save it.
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
I think that the extravigant cluster is interesting to me and I think that a marketing team could focus on making an item that is expensive and higher quality because people with lots of money like to buy expensive things to flaunt their wealth. By making items more expensive, people with more money might want to uy them more for the pride.
